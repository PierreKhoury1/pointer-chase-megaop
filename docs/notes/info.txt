x86 VPGATHER (Vector Gather). Indirect Addressing with "Post-Increment" (DSP and Older CISC). Many Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) and older CISC architectures (like the Motorola 68000) had "Indirect with Post-increment/Pre-decrement." While not a multi-level chase, it combined the dereference and the pointer update into one instruction. Intel's Data Streaming Accelerator (DSA): This is a specialised silicon block on modern Xeon chips It has "instructions" (descriptors) that can perform memory-to-memory moves and follow descriptor. With the Intel DSA (Data Streaming Accelerator), you don't write a single opcode like CHASE. Instead, you prepare a Descriptor—a 64-byte block of memory that defines the job—and then use the ENQCMD (Enqueue Command) instruction to send it to the hardware. If you wanted to perform a "pointer-chase-like" operation where the hardware moves data based on addresses it finds, you would chain descriptors together. The DSA Work Descriptor (Simplified). A descriptor is a struct that tells the silicon exactly what to do. For a pointer-based move, it looks roughly like this: the starting pointer and the depth (everything else the processor can work out) pointer chasing + offset , starting pointer, and the list of offsets if you can assume all offsets are between a range of memory (you can alter the bits) for each level of pointer chasing we need an additional bit for the check the mega instruction should have the minimal number of bits ( and the procsessor can work out the rest) optimize for real world workloads restrict the encoding of the nesting depth to the language what is *****p (what can be saved in terms of instructions on the lower level)
